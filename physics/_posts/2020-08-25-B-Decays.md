title: "Decays of B Mesons: An Introduction for the Layperson"
categories: physics

This is a little post about a topic which is close to my heart: B decays. These are what I did my research on during my Masters, and I still like to keep up with developments in this sector in my off-time. Hopefully this proves an accessible, though challenging, introduction.

Let's hop to it!

## Preliminaries

### Quarks

Quarks are some of the fundamental particles in the Standard Model (our current best-fit model) of particle physics. To be a bit more specific, they are _charged fermions_, meaning they have electric charge, and half-integer spin - it's not particularly important at the moment to know exactly what "spin" is.

There are six "flavours" of quark: down ($$d$$), up ($$u$$), charm ($$c$$), strange ($$s$$), bottom (or beauty, for those of a more poetic bent) ($$b$$), and top ($$t$$). These are matched by antiquark versions, with equal mass, spin and so on, but opposite electric charge. The antiquarks, as with all antiparticles, are denoted by a bar across the top of the letter.

### B Mesons

Let's go up a bit in particle-size, and talk about mesons. Mesons are "bound states" - i.e. composites - of a quark and an antiquark: $$q \bar{q}$$. Contrast these with baryons, which carry an odd number (usually three, though baryons with five have been found) of quarks.

B mesons, specifically, are those with a $$b$$ quark or antiquark; the other quark (I'll henceforth imply charge conjugation - i.e. antiparticles - whenever I say "quark" or similar) is indicated usually by a subscript next to the $$B$$; for example, a $$B_s$$ meson has a beauty and a strange quark. The overall charge of the meson is then indicated as usual by a superscript: $$B^0_s$$.

#### Decays

B mesons can decay via so-called flavour-changing neutral current (FCNC) processes, whose Feynman diagrams are often called "penguin diagrams" because you can rearrange them tortuously to make something vaguely reminiscent of a penguin, if you've had enough bevs to occupy a frat party for one night:

These are weak processes (i.e. they proceed via the weak interaction - the W and Z bosons there). Note how many vertices there are, and where the vertices are. These will be important later.

### Couplings

The last thing that we need to chat about before we get on to the meat of the topic is "coupling". Whenever you have a vertex in a Feynman diagram; that is, an interaction between particles, those particles will have a coupling value. This coupling value will essentially be multiplied with the couplings at all the other verticesto obtain the probability of that Feynman diagram occurring. This then affects the "branching ratio", the proportion that one process takes up, out of all decays of the given initial particle.

In general, couplings are $$\alpha \lt 1$$ where $$\alpha$$ is the coupling. This means that the more vertices there are in the diagram, the less likely it is to occur. This, you can think of as satisfying our fundamental instinct that more "simple" processes are more likely to happen.

Now, the coupling is affected basically by the combination of particles which form the vertex in question: different particles, different coupling (in the general sense).

Another way to change the likelihood of an overall process happening is to increase the number of Feynman diagrams for it. Intuitively, this makes sense: the more _ways_ something can happen, the more likely that thing is to happen, in general.

### How High-Energy Physics Experimentation Works

Now that the Higgs boson has been discovered, particle physics experiments, particularly at CERN, are focused on finding evidence of Beyond Standard Model (BSM) physics. We know that there is _something_ outside the SM, since there are phenomena which the SM does not adequately explain, such as the matter/antimatter asymmetry in the universe. However, there has to date been no strong proof of the SM being _wrong_. Everything the SM predicts has, thus far, been proven correct.

Experiments such as the LHC are aimed at showing up differences ("tensions") between reality, and SM predictions. These predictions from the SM cover many different areas, but are all based around "observables"; things we can measure. These including decay probabilities, angular distributions, and so on. For the purposes of our discussion here, we can split them into two categories: branching fractions, and angular observables.

## Bringing it all Together

So now that we have some context, let's look at how decays of B mesons might help us uncover new physics.

### Rare B Decays

Some decays of B mesons are very rare, compared to others. The one illustrated above, with $$B^0_s \rightarrow K^{*0} \mu^+ \mu^-$$, is an example. These are much more rare than decays to, say, the $$J/\psi$$. Rare decays such as these are often promising candidates for new physics, since any BSM contributions will show up somewhat more readily. If you have a decay that's got a probability of 0.95, and add a BSM contribution of 0.001, that won't show up much. But if you have a decay that in the SM has a probability of 0.01, then that 0.001 contribution is suddenly quite big, as a proportion of the SM prediction.

### The Anomaly

No, we haven't suddenly veered into some weird section of futuristic sci-fi.

In the period around 2015-2017, LHCb, CMS, and ATLAS demonstrated comparatively large tensions between experimental results and Standard Model predictions, in the branching fractions and angular observables, for a few different rare B decay processes. These tensions were not enough for _proof_ of new physics, but were certainly not something that could be easily ignored.

Subsequent analyses have shown that BSM theories (which introduce new particles and hence extra diagrams) could explain the observed tensions. A lot of work at Belle and LHCb since has been focused on trying to nail down these tensions, and obtain more precise measurements. This work is mirrored in the theory space, where physicists are trying to reduce uncertainties in some of the quantities that come into play in the SM calculations.

### My Work

During my (all-too-short) time working alongside an LHCb researcher, we were looking at so-called "inclusive" searches for rare B decays. These searches are contrasted with "exclusive" searches, which look for specific decays (such as that mentioned above). Exclusive channels are theoretically thorny and the SM predictions are quite tough to nail down. So the hope is that by going for a more theoretically clean decay mode, the SM predictions can be tightened up. Unfortunately, inclusive decays are tough experimentally; since backgrounds are much more problematic. When all you have to go on is "two muons came out of this decay at some point", turns out you get a lot of false positives! Our work was, therefore, focused on finding ways to filter out those false positives.

## Conclusion

Hopefully you found this interesting, and accessible. I'll keep doing these physics posts every now and then, I'm thinking mostly as literature reviews for laypeople.

Anywho; as you can tell, I'm sure, this is one of the most promising avenues we presently have for new physics, so watch this space. Maybe one day (hopefully in the near future) I'll be excitedly posting a blog about some evidence of BSM physics in this sector!
