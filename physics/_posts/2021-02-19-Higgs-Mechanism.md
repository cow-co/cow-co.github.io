In this post, we're going to cover the Higgs mechanism. We'll be diving into a little bit of depth, conceptually, but will be avoiding a lot of the maths. Hopefully this will ensure it is accessible to the layperson.

So let's hop to it!

## Lagrangian Formulation for Fields

We will start with the Lagrangian formalism. The Lagrangian of a system is a description of its energy state: $\mathcal{L} = T - V$, where $T$ and $V$ are the kinetic and potential energies, respectively. This is the classical, particle-based formulation of the Lagrangian. Note that it shows the *difference* between the two kinds of energy; contrast this with the Hamiltonian, which is the *total* energy: $H = T + V$. Combining a Lagrangian with the Euler-Lagrange equations (which I will provide here, but you needn't understand the maths)

$$\frac{d}{dt}\left(\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial \dot{q_i}}\right) = \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial q_i}$$

allows us to find the equations of motion for the system.

We can re-formulate this in order to be appropriate for *fields*. A field is a mathematical object which carries some value at every point in the space; temperature is a scalar field, for example, whilst the magnetic field is a vector field.
