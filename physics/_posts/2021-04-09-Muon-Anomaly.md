More good news, everyone! Fermilab today (8th April 2021) released a paper (or technically three) presenting their most up-to-date results for the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon [[1](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.03281.pdf), [2](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.03247.pdf), [3](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.03201.pdf)]. Their results uphold, and tighten, earlier results from Brookhaven [[4](https://arxiv.org/pdf/hep-ex/0602035.pdf)], and exhibit a 4.2$$\sigma$$ deviation from the Standard Model predictions.

In this post, I'll explain what this is all about, and some of the interpretations in the context of BSM physics.

## Theory: Anomalous Magnetic Moments

The magnetic moment of an object that generates a magnetic field essentially tells us the strength of the field it generates. In the original Dirac equation, the magnetic moment of the electron, $$g_e$$, was predicted to be equal to 2. However, experimental data subsequently indicated that $$g_e$$ was not exactly 2; Schwinger put forward the idea that this "anomalous" moment was due to various "radiative" corrections based on electroweak and QCD processes not accounted for in the original Dirac formulation.

Very similar results were then obtained for the muon (which provided evidence of structure in the SM based around the generations of the leptons). The muon system, however, grants us much more opportunity to uncover new physics (which would enter via extra radiative corrections corresponding to new particles) since the relative contribution from those new particles is much greater in the muon anomaly.

## The Experiment

The Fermilab MUON $$g - 2$$ experiment aims to measure the muon anomalous magnetic moment $$a_\mu = \frac{g_\mu - 2}{2}$$. It does this by injecting muons into a "storage ring" (SR), where the bunches are focused using magnets. The analysis basically measured the frequencies at which the muons' spins precessed; it does so by measuring the directions in which electrons are emitted. The direction of electron emission is correlated with the muon spin, due to $$P$$-violation in the muon decay.

> Parity (or $$P$$) symmetry is the symmetry whereby processes behave the same under a "parity" transformation. Parity may be thought of as a slightly tweaked form of *reflection* in a mirror. So the idea is that if $$P$$ holds, then a process and its mirror-image will behave the same. Parity *violation* occurs in some weak processes, where things will happen preferentially in a particular direction, disregarding $$P$$ symmetry.

Of course the actual analysis required a lot more than simply this (required very precise clocks, measurements of the magnetic field in the SR, etc). But what I've described is what you really need to know as a layperson. Read the papers if you want more detail!

## The Result

The final result Fermilab arrived at, when combined with an earlier Brookhaven lab result, was $$a_\mu = 116 592 061(41) \times 10^{-11}$$, with a precision of 0.35 parts per million (for comparison, $$a_e$$ - the electron anomaly - is measured at the parts-per-billion level). This differs from the theoretical prediction from the SM, by 4.2$$\sigma$$, which is very exciting!

## Interpretations

A lot of the theoretical interpretations of the result have centred around supersymmetry (SUSY); sparticles (supersymmetric particles) could contribute extra radiative corrections, thus increasing the anomalous moment [[5](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.03217.pdf), [6](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.03223.pdf), [7](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.03294.pdf)]. But we'll need to watch this space to see whether forthcoming upgrades to the Fermilab experimental equipment will tighten the results and get it over that 5$$\sigma$$ line, at which point we can really go ham with seeing which BSM model fits the data best.

I hope you found this quick overview interesting! I had to take a bit of time today reading about the specifics of the Fermilab setup and the background of the anomaly, because I hadn't really paid it much attention till now.

Next post will be covering yet *another* good-looking anomaly (from a few months back now), potentially hinting at dark matter!
