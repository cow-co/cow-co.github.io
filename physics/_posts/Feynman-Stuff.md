If you have an interest in physics, particularly particle physics, then chances are you've seen a Feynman diagram.

This kind of thing.

But what *are* they, really? How do they help us to do physics? That's what I hope to clear up for you today.

## Not Just a Pretty Face

First thing to note about Feynman diagrams is that they are not simply schematic. They aren't just to show a pictorial representation of what's going on. They are, in fact, an integral part of conducting particle physics calculations. To do so, we use the **Feynman Rules**.

### Feynman Rules: A Quick Introduction

The Feynman rules allow us to calculate a quantity called the "amplitude", or "matrix element". This is a value which essentially tells us the *likelihood* of the diagram in question happening.

A given process (say, electron-muon scattering) can generally proceed by many specific diagrams. For example, here are two diagrams for electron-muon scattering:



Each diagram will have its own probability of happening. The amplitude, $$\mathcal{M}$$, tells us what this probability is (more strictly, it's the squared amplitude, averaged over spins where necessary, that does this).
