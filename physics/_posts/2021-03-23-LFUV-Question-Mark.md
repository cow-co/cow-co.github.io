title: "What's all this About a Hint at New Physics?"
categories: physics

So you may have heard today (23rd March 2021) that CERN has published some results which hint at new physics. You may be wondering what all the fuss is about, and maybe you want to learn a bit about the physics that is in play. So that's what I'll chat about here.

## Intro

Quick introduction. Today, the LHCb collaboration (you can read about the little bit of work I've done with them [elsewhere on this blog]({ % post_url 2020-08-25-B-Decays %})) released [a paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.11769.pdf) onto ArXiV, showing some evidence pointing towards physics beyond the Standard Model.

The evidence is not concrete; it's a solid *hint* at new physics, but not *proof* of it. The significance of the tension is $$3.1\sigma$$, whereas the usual baseline for a "discovery" is $$5\sigma$$. But 3.1 is still a tantalising glimpse (a similar tension exists in the angular observables for $$B^0_s \rightarrow K^{*0} \mu^+ \mu^-$$).

## Lepton Flavour Universality

One of the predictions of the Standard Model is that all the lepton flavours ($$\tau$$, $$\mu$$, $$e$$) should hve the same couplings, except for their couplings to the Higgs; it is this *non*-universality in their Higgs couplings which results in their differing masses.

But this prediction is not a core, fundamental result of quantum field theory; it is merely a quirk of the Standard Model. Several models of BSM physics introduce new particles which can break this universality, which would lead to decays involving one lepton flavour behaving differently than decays involving a different flavour.

So by searching for evidence of *violation* of lepton flavour universality (LFUV), we hope to find evidence of new physics.

## The Search

So what data were the LHCb people working with here? Well, they were effectively repeating [a previous analysis](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1903.09252.pdf), but this time with $$4$$ fb$$^{-1}$$ worth of extra data.


> **Barns**

> The barn is a unit of area, often used when describing cross-section-related quantities at the subatomic level. The inverse femtobarn (fb$$^{-1}$$) is the standard measure of "integrated luminosity" for a particle collider - basically a measure of how many interactions we're getting at the interaction point; it is the number of collisions per femtobarn of target cross-sectional area.

The analysis itself involves *branching fractions* from charged $$B$$ mesons, to a charged kaon and two leptons: $$B^+ \rightarrow K^+ \ell^+ \ell^-$$ (where charge conjugation is implied as usual). The ratio between the branching fractions to different leptons is then calculated, and we see how/if it differs from unity.

> **Branching Fraction**
>
> The branching fraction of a process is the fraction of all events, that proceed via that process. That is, if we have 100 "$$Y$$-decay" events, and 10 go via $$Y \rightarrow Z$$ and 90 via $$Y \rightarrow A$$, then the two channels have branching fractions 0.10 and 0.90 respectively.

The LHCb team used muon and electron decays for this analysis, and also used the (fairly common in $$B$$ analyses) technique of measuring the branching fractions of interest against similar decays involving the $$J/\psi$$. The reason this is done is to eliminate certain considerations around uncertainties and efficiencies in the analysis, since the $$J/\psi$$ resonance is pretty well-understood and has some useful properties for these purposes.

## The Results

The LHCb team arrived at a result of $$0.846^{+0.044}_{-0.041}$$, which differs from the SM prediction of unity by $$3.1\sigma$$, as noted earlier.

This gives us another really promising avenue to look for new physics. Now we just have to wait for more results - the upgraded LHCb (as part of LHC Long Shutdown 2), coming back online in 2022, has the potential to get us some even better results.

Anyway, I hope you enjoyed this quick blast through this really exciting bit of news. I'll see you next time.

PS. If you're that way inclined, I definitely recommend reading the paper itself. It's pretty approachable, as these things go.
