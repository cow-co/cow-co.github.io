Hi! I'm cow-co, and I do a whole bunch of different things in my spare time. This blog is where I kinda brain-dump my thoughts and guides on how to do various things, such as security, machine learning, and physics.

I have a few different GitHub accounts. My main one is [cow-co](https://github.com/cow-co), where I work on web apps and assorted other miscellaneous things. I also have [cybersecmoo](https://github.com/cybersecmoo), where I work on cybersecurity projects, and [sci-cow](https://github.com/sci-cow), where I work on high-energy physics simulations.
